            <article>
                <p>Hello there, my name is Jordan Drumev, I was born in 1994 in the city of Tutrakan. From 2001 to 2008
                    I studied in the "Yordan Yovkov" high school and from 2008 to 2013 I attended the "Geo Milev"
                    English language school in Ruse. After graduating high school I enrolled in the "Business
                    Management" course in the "Angel Kanchev" university in Ruse from 2013 to 2017. Shortly after
                    finishing my university course I began work in "Orgachim Resins" as an assistant supply manager.
                    While working there I started to slowly adopt the hobby of web programming, initially making simple
                    HTML pages with bare-bones CSS and later with more advanced CSS and some limited JS functionality.
                    As time went on it became more and more apparent that my work life left me with very little free
                    time for any other activities. Seeing as how my interest in programming wasn't weaning by the end of
                    2018 I had decided that I want to pursue my hobby as a full time job. After quitting my job at
                    "Orgachim Resins" I started working in my family's store which allowed me to have a lot more free
                    time to study web programming. In the beginning of 2020 I decided that if I wanted to gain more
                    in-depth knowledge about web programming I needed to find a job with experienced co-workers from
                    whom I can learn.</p>

                    HTML was my first interaction with website building and web programming back in the end of 2017.
                    Starting with absolutely no knowledge of HTML, I was fascinated with even the most basic things like
                    HTML elements, making links or forms and using Iframes. Before this I never thought about how sites
                    were build and now I'd go to some sites just to see how they were structured and if they were using
                    semantic HTML or any other HTML5 elements. Since then I've learned a lot about HTML, for instance:
                    semantic HTML(like the one used to make this site), how to make basic use of canvas, but there are
                    other things that I still want to learn(SVG being one of them).

                <p>Shortly after learning the basics of HTML I started to tinker with the CSS. Initially just changing
                    the color, size and background of the font with inline code then I learned about the selectors and
                    internal CSS. After that came the padding, margin, borders and the box model along with how
                    different elements are displayed and how they can be positioned . I also learned about specificity,
                    css variables, box sizing, transitions, animations and flexbox, grid, media queries which are some
                    of the tool used to make a responsive website.</p>

                <p>HTML and CSS are essential for building a website, but to make it actually function a website
                    requires JavaScript. JS was the hardest of the three languages to learn not only because it has a
                    lot more to it than the other two, but also because it was my first contact with real programming. I
                    started slowly with basic programming concepts like variables and their types, if statements, loops,
                    functions, recursion and scopes. After that I moved on to more in-depth study of each variable type,
                    their specifics and methods. At that time I also started to learn about all the things that
                    differentiate JS from most other languages and also recursion because I didn't get it the first
                    time. Probably the biggest of these differences are the lax rules when declaring a variable, no need
                    to specify a type or a size, hoisting and the lack of local scope prior to the introduction of let
                    and const. As time went on I got the hang of all these concepts and more, my current frontier is
                    learning how the event loop works.</p>
